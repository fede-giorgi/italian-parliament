# Data

## Description

This project relies on the official **Linked Open Data (LOD)** repository maintained by the **Camera dei Deputati (Chamber of Deputies)**. Unlike static archival datasets, this repository functions as a living digital archive of the Italian Republic, updated continuously to reflect parliamentary activity in real-time.

The analysis focuses specifically on the **XIX Legislature**, which commenced on October 13, 2022. This period represents a significant break in the recent history of Italian political instability, characterized by a clear electoral winner and a defined parliamentary majority.

## Structure and Dimensions

Unlike the flat, wide-format CSV files common in political science research, the primary source data is structured as a **semantic graph (RDF/XML)**. To make this complex web of relationships accessible for quantitative analysis, the data has been parsed and flattened into five distinct, relational dataframes using the R statistical environment:

-   **`votazione-19.rdf` (Votes):** The core dataset containing the outcomes of parliamentary votes. It includes metadata on the subject of the vote (e.g., amendments, confidence votes) and the aggregate tallies (Present, Voting, Ayes, Nays, Abstentions).
-   **`seduta-19.rdf` (Sessions):** The "calendar" of the Chamber. This dataset links every vote to a specific session date, providing the temporal backbone necessary to analyze the rhythm of legislative work (Story II).
-   **`deputato-19.rdf` (Deputies):** The demographic registry of the 400 elected officials. It contains personal attributes such as gender, age, profession, and education level, allowing for the sociological profiling of the ruling class (Story I).
-   **`elezione-19.rdf` (Elections):** The geographic link. This file connects individual deputies to their specific electoral colleges and constituencies, enabling the spatial analysis of representation across the North-South divide.
-   **`gruppoParlamentare-19.rdf` (Groups):** A reference dictionary that maps internal group codes to the official names of Parliamentary Groups (Parties), essential for decoding political affiliations.

### Missing Data and NAs

The dataset presents distinct categories of missing values (NAs), which are not merely errors but reflections of either genuine information gaps or structural features of the Italian electoral system.

* **Undeclared Personal Information:** A portion of the NAs stems from the voluntary nature of certain disclosures. For instance, in the demographic analysis, missing values in the "Education Level" or "Profession" fields occur when a deputy chooses not to publicly declare these details in their official profile.
* **Structural NAs (First-Past-the-Post Candidates):** A significant number of missing values in the "Party" field is a byproduct of the mixed electoral law (*Rosatellum*). Candidates elected in single-member districts (first-past-the-post) are technically supported by a coalition rather than a single list. Consequently, the raw data for these deputies lacks a direct link to a specific party acronym.
* **Regional Anomalies (Valle d'Aosta):** The autonomous region of Valle d'Aosta operates under a unique legal framework with a single-member constituency system that differs from the national standard.

## Data Quality and Challenges

The transition from Semantic Web standards (triplets) to tabular data presents specific challenges. A preliminary review confirmed that while the numerical data (vote counts) is robust, the categorical metadata required significant harmonization.

## Access

The data is publicly available through the [dati.camera.it](http://dati.camera.it/it/) portal under an Open Data license (CC-BY 4.0), ensuring transparency and reproducibility. While the Chamber provides the raw RDF dumps, the parsing algorithms used to transform these triplets into the R dataframes used in this study are original to this project.
