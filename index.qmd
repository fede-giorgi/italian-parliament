# Introduction

For the international observer, Italian politics is often reduced to a caricature of instability: a revolving door of Prime Ministers, technocratic crisis managers, and executives that barely last longer than a football season. Since the birth of the Republic in 1946, Italy has seen nearly 70 different governments: an average of one every 13 months.

For us, as two Italians, this volatility is not just a statistic; it is the background noise of our civic lives. We are accustomed to a system designed to prevent authoritarianism but often accused of breeding paralysis. We know the rituals: the consultations at the Quirinale, the votes of confidence, and the constant reshuffling of alliances.

However, the current **XIX Legislature** offers a rare opportunity for analysis. For the first time in years, the Chamber of Deputies is not held hostage by a fragile coalition, but is driven by a clear political majority. This shift changes the physics of the parliamentary hall. It moves the conversation from *"will the government survive the night?"* to *"how is the legislative machine actually functioning?"*

Beneath the headlines and the talk-show rhetoric, the Parliament is a massive data generator. Every electronic vote, every committee attendance, and every legislative text leaves a digital footprint.

In this project, we move beyond the narrative of instability to look at the empirical reality. Using the Linked Open Data provided by the *Camera dei Deputati*, we perform a quantitative autopsy of the current term, organized into three distinct stories:

-   **The Players (Who Represents Us?)** Before analyzing their actions, we must understand their identity. Who sits in the 400 seats of the reduced Chamber? We explore the demographics, the "Meloni Paradox" regarding gender balance, and the sharp geographic divide that still splits the country between North and South.

-   **The "Short Week" Reality** There is a popular saying that deputies work only from Tuesday to Thursday. Is it a populist myth or a statistical fact? We analyze the timestamps of thousands of votes to reveal the true heartbeat of the Chamber, exposing the "school calendar" rhythm of legislative activity.

-   **The Palace Games** Beyond the shouting matches on TV, how does the voting machine actually work? We map the **"Geometry of Consensus"** to show that enemies often vote together on technicalities, expose the tactical use of **Strategic Abstention**, and analyze whether the solid majority truly holds when the final roll call is summoned.

This is not just a study of laws; it is a data-driven tour of the Italian Parliament, stripping away the noise to see how the Republic actually works.
