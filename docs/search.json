    "text": "1 Introduction\nFor the international observer, Italian politics is often reduced to a caricature of instability: a revolving door of Prime Ministers, technocratic crisis managers, and executives that barely last longer than a football season. Since the birth of the Republic in 1946, Italy has seen nearly 70 different governments: an average of one every 13 months.\nFor us, as two Italians, this volatility is not just a statistic; it is the background noise of our civic lives. We are accustomed to a system designed to prevent authoritarianism but often accused of breeding paralysis. We know the rituals: the consultations at the Quirinale, the votes of confidence, and the constant reshuffling of alliances.\nHowever, the current XIX Legislature offers a rare opportunity for analysis. For the first time in years, the Chamber of Deputies is not held hostage by a fragile coalition, but is driven by a clear political majority. This shift changes the physics of the parliamentary hall. It moves the conversation from “will the government survive the night?” to “how is the legislative machine actually functioning?”\nBeneath the headlines and the talk-show rhetoric, the Parliament is a massive data generator. Every electronic vote, every committee attendance, and every legislative text leaves a digital footprint.\nIn this project, we move beyond the narrative of instability to look at the empirical reality. Using the Linked Open Data provided by the Camera dei Deputati, we perform a quantitative autopsy of the current term, organized into three distinct stories:\n\nThe Players (Who Represents Us?) Before analyzing their actions, we must understand their identity. Who sits in the 400 seats of the reduced Chamber? We explore the demographics, the “Meloni Paradox” regarding gender balance, and the sharp geographic divide that still splits the country between North and South.\nThe “Short Week” Reality There is a popular saying that deputies work only from Tuesday to Thursday. Is it a populist myth or a statistical fact? We analyze the timestamps of thousands of votes to reveal the true heartbeat of the Chamber, exposing the “school calendar” rhythm of legislative activity.\nThe Palace Games Beyond the shouting matches on TV, how does the voting machine actually work? We map the “Geometry of Consensus” to show that enemies often vote together on technicalities, expose the tactical use of Strategic Abstention, and analyze whether the solid majority truly holds when the final roll call is summoned.\n\nThis is not just a study of laws; it is a data-driven tour of the Italian Parliament, stripping away the noise to see how the Republic actually works.",

Following the constitutional referendum of 2020, the number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies has been drastically cut from 630 to 400.\nThis smaller, leaner assembly is no longer just a crowd; it is a selected cohort where every single vote carries more weight than ever before. But who are these 400 individuals chosen to represent a nation of 60 million? Are they the usual career politicians, or has the reduction of seats created a new breed of representative?\nBefore we analyze what they do, we must understand who they are.

    "text": "2.2 Structure and Dimensions\nUnlike the flat, wide-format CSV files common in political science research, the primary source data is structured as a semantic graph (RDF/XML). To make this complex web of relationships accessible for quantitative analysis, the data has been parsed and flattened into five distinct, relational dataframes using the R statistical environment:\n\nvotazione-19.rdf (Votes): The core dataset containing the outcomes of parliamentary votes. It includes metadata on the subject of the vote (e.g., amendments, confidence votes) and the aggregate tallies (Present, Voting, Ayes, Nays, Abstentions).\nseduta-19.rdf (Sessions): The “calendar” of the Chamber. This dataset links every vote to a specific session date, providing the temporal backbone necessary to analyze the rhythm of legislative work (Story II).\ndeputato-19.rdf (Deputies): The demographic registry of the 400 elected officials. It contains personal attributes such as gender, age, profession, and education level, allowing for the sociological profiling of the ruling class (Story I).\nelezione-19.rdf (Elections): The geographic link. This file connects individual deputies to their specific electoral colleges and constituencies, enabling the spatial analysis of representation across the North-South divide.\ngruppoParlamentare-19.rdf (Groups): A reference dictionary that maps internal group codes to the official names of Parliamentary Groups (Parties), essential for decoding political affiliations.\n\n\n2.2.1 Missing Data and NAs\nThe dataset presents distinct categories of missing values (NAs), which are not merely errors but reflections of either genuine information gaps or structural features of the Italian electoral system.\n\nUndeclared Personal Information: A portion of the NAs stems from the voluntary nature of certain disclosures. For instance, in the demographic analysis, missing values in the “Education Level” or “Profession” fields occur when a deputy chooses not to publicly declare these details in their official profile.\nStructural NAs (First-Past-the-Post Candidates): A significant number of missing values in the “Party” field is a byproduct of the mixed electoral law (Rosatellum). Candidates elected in single-member districts (first-past-the-post) are technically supported by a coalition rather than a single list. Consequently, the raw data for these deputies lacks a direct link to a specific party acronym.\nRegional Anomalies (Valle d’Aosta): The autonomous region of Valle d’Aosta operates under a unique legal framework with a single-member constituency system that differs from the national standard.",

    "text": "2.3 Data Quality and Limitations\nThe transition from Semantic Web standards (triplets) to tabular data presents specific challenges. A preliminary review confirms that while the numerical data (vote counts) is robust and complete, the categorical metadata requires significant harmonization.\nSpecifically, the “Missing Data Analysis” reveals a structural limitation regarding Parliamentary Groups (parties). In the raw RDF structure, party affiliation is often referenced via “Blank Nodes” or links to external datasets (organo.rdf) not included in this specific snapshot. Consequently, while we can track the behavior of individual deputies with high precision, mapping them to their specific political parties requires inferential matching or supplementary data collection.\nFurthermore, the dataset distinguishes between the theoretical composition of the Chamber and the active workforce. Resignations, substitutions (subentri), and deaths create a fluctuating number of active IDs, which must be normalized to avoid skewing attendance metrics.",

    "text": "3.1.1 The Numbers of Power\nThe snap elections of September 25, 2022, delivered a decisive verdict, ending a decade of hung parliaments. The vote handed a sweeping majority to the Center-Right coalition, driven by the unprecedented rise of Fratelli d’Italia (FdI), which established itself as the leading political force.\nThis outcome was amplified by the “Rosatellum” electoral law, a complex mixed system. Out of 400 seats, 148 deputies were elected via the uninominal colleges (First Past the Post method). These candidates were supported by the entire coalition, and in the voting data, they are often grouped by their broader bloc rather than a single list, while the remaining were assigned via proportional plurinominal lists.\nDoes this translate into a solid command of the Chamber? The data confirms a clear numerical advantage.\n\n\nCode\n# Plotting the Chamber Composition based on the final cleaned dataset\ndf_deputati_final |&gt;\n  # 1.

The ultimate “glass ceiling” was broken by the Right, with Giorgia Meloni becoming the first female Prime Minister in the Republic’s history. This historical achievement came despite the fact that political battles for gender quotas and structural equality have traditionally been hallmarks of the Left.\nIs this a true paradox? The data below provides a clear answer: No.\nWhile the Right produced the national figurehead, Left and Center-Left parties structurally elect and maintain a significantly higher percentage of women within their own ranks, keeping their internal composition much closer to the overall parliamentary average. The structural commitment to gender balance remains clearly stronger on the left side of the political spectrum.\nThe chart below visualizes this divide, sorting parties by their percentage of female representatives.\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

    "text": "3.2 The “Short Week” Reality\nThere is a popular and often malicious saying in Rome: Parliament opens on Tuesday and closes on Thursday. The stereotype depicts deputies as commuters who arrive in the capital on Monday night and rush to the airports by Thursday afternoon.\nIs this just a populist myth? The data suggests otherwise.\n\n3.2.1 The Weekly Rhythm\nThe analysis of voting timestamps confirms the “Short Week” is not a myth; it is the operating system of the Chamber. The legislative machine runs at full speed only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Mondays and Fridays are phantom days, with almost zero voting activity. The data validates the stereotype: for the average deputy, the parliamentary week effectively lasts 48 to 72 hours.\n\n\nCode\n# 1. Data Preparation: Extracting Time Components\ndf_activity &lt;- df_votazioni |&gt;\n  # Convert the date string (YYYYMMDD) into a proper Date object\n  mutate(date = ymd(date)) |&gt;\n  # Remove rows with missing dates\n  filter(!is.na(date)) |&gt;\n  # Extract the Day of the Week (Mon, Tue, Wed...)\n  # label = TRUE returns text (e.g., \"Monday\") instead of numbers\n  mutate(weekday = wday(date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE, week_start = 1))\n\n# 2. Visualization (Styled to match Seasonality Chart)\ndf_activity |&gt; \n  # Count the total number of votes for each weekday\n  count(weekday) |&gt;\n  \n  # group = 1 is necessary to tell ggplot to connect the categorical days with a line\n  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = n, group = 1)) +\n  \n  # Area Chart (Background fill)\n  geom_area(fill = \"#E6E6FA\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  \n  # Line Chart (The Trend)\n  geom_line(color = \"#6A5ACD\", size = 1.2) +\n  \n  # Points (The Markers)\n  geom_point(color = \"#483D8B\", size = 3) +\n\n  # Theme Adjustments\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), # Remove vertical grid lines\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11, face = \"bold\"),\n    # Add a bit of upper margin to fit the text labels\n    plot.margin = margin(t = 10, r = 10, b = 10, l = 10) \n  ) +\n  \n  # Adjust Y scale to make room for labels\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.15))) +\n  \n  # Final Labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Weekly Work Rhythm\", \n    subtitle = \"Volume of votes by day of the week: The Tuesday-Wednesday Peak\", \n    x = \"\", \n    y = \"Total Votes Cast\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Summer Vacation\nParliamentary activity is strictly dictated by the calendar of holidays. August is the month of the great exodus: the Chamber effectively shuts down for the summer break, dropping to near-zero activity.\nConversely, July witnesses a frantic spike in voting, a legislative sprint to clear the desk before the holidays begin. Coupled with the traditional December rush for the Budget Law, the data reveals a clear cyclic rhythm: the Parliament operates on a “school calendar,” with distinct terms and long vacations.\n\n\nCode\n# 1. Data Preparation\ndf_votazioni |&gt;\n  # Convert string dates to Date objects\n  mutate(date = ymd(date)) |&gt; \n  # Filter out rows with invalid/missing dates\n  filter(!is.na(date)) |&gt; \n  # Extract the full month name (e.g., \"January\", \"February\")\n  mutate(month_label = month(date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)) |&gt;\n  \n  # 2.

    "text": "While this analysis provides a structural X-ray of the XIX Legislature, it remains a macroscopic overview: a map of the battlefield rather than a chronicle of every duel. The current dataset allows us to measure volume and alignment, but to truly decode the “game of politics,” we must dig deeper into the nuances of parliamentary behavior.\nThe following areas represent the next frontier for this research, requiring the integration of more granular data streams:\n\nInternal Cohesion and “Snipers” (Franchi Tiratori): Our current analysis treats parties as monolithic blocks. However, political drama often lies in the cracks. By integrating individual roll-call votes (who voted for what), we could measure Party Discipline Indices to identify which groups are most prone to internal rebellion and spot the so-called “snipers” who vote against their own coalition in secret ballots.\nThe “Turncoat” Phenomenon (Cambio di Casacca): The current snapshot assigns one party per deputy based on election results or current affiliation. A longitudinal analysis tracking changes in group affiliation over time would reveal the volatility of political loyalty, quantifying the phenomenon of trasformismo that has historically plagued Italian parliaments.\nSemantic Conflict Analysis: We know how they vote, but not always what they are fighting about. Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the text of amendments and parliamentary debates would allow us to map the Thematic Polarization. Are economic issues more divisive than civil rights? Do technical bills generate more cross-party consensus than ideological manifestos?\nGovernment vs. Parliament Efficiency: Finally, a crucial metric is missing: the Success Rate. How many bills proposed by MPs actually become law compared to those initiated by the Government? Analyzing the “mortality rate” of private member bills versus government decrees would definitively answer whether the Parliament remains a legislative power or has evolved into a mere ratification chamber for the Executive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the numbers confirm the stability and discipline of the current majority, the true health of a democracy is measured not just by the efficiency of its voting machine, but by the quality of its debate and the independence of its representatives. Expanding this dataset is the first step toward that deeper understanding.",
