    "text": "1 Introduction\nTo anyone watching from abroad, Italian politics probably looks like chaos. Since 1946, Italy has burned through nearly 70 different governments, which works out to one every 13 months or so. The system was built after Mussolini to make sure no one could grab too much power, but it has caused decades of fragile coalitions and political conflicts.\nAs two Italians, we’ve grown up watching the same cycle play out.\nBut the current legislature, the XIX, is actually different, and what makes it worth studying is that for the first time, there’s a genuine majority in the Chamber of Deputies. Now, instead of asking “will this government make it to next month?”, we can actually ask “what is it actually doing?”\nAnd it turns out Parliament generates a lot of data including electronic vote, committee session, and draft bill so we wanted to look at what the numbers show and organized our analysis around three questions:\n1. Who’s in the room? The Chamber was reduced to 400 seats this legislature. What does that mean for representation? Is it more women, fewer women? Are Southern regions still underrepresented compared to the North?\n2. When does Parliament actually work? There’s a running “fallacy” that MPs only show up Tuesday through Thursday. Is that true? Can we see it in the voting timestamps?\n3. How do parties actually vote? Coalition partners are supposed to vote together, and the opposition is supposed to oppose. But how messy is the reality? Who breaks ranks, and at what stage of the voting?",

The data gets updated in real time as Parliament does its work, which means we’re looking at a live picture of legislative activity.\nWe focused specifically on the XIX Legislature (started on October 13, 2022) which breaks the pattern of the last several years: there is a clear winner in the election, a stable majority, and the government is not mingled together from five different parties that cannot agree on legislatures. That makes it a useful case study for understanding how the Parliament behaves when it’s not constantly fighting.",

RDF stores everything as triplets, which is useful for representing linked data but doesn’t translate easily into tables you need for analysis. We had to write custom parsing scripts to flatten the data out, and in some cases we had to manually reconstruct relationships that got lost in the process.\nAnother issue was that a lot of fields are just raw strings such as profession and level of education: these often came as free text rather than standardized categories. We spent a fair amount of time cleaning and standardizing these fields before we could do anything useful with them.",

    "text": "3.1 The Players (Who Represents Us?)\nThe following section loads the R libraries, and executes the parsing of the raw Linked Open Data (RDF) provided by the Chamber of Deputies.\nThe XIX Legislature is the first to operate under the new constitutional rules approved in the 2020 referendum, which cut the Chamber of Deputies from 630 to 400. Now each vote matters more, and each seat is harder to win, so we think the bar for getting elected should be higher.\nFirst we must understand who they are. Are we looking at the same pool of career politicians who have cycled through Italian institutions for decades, or did the smaller chamber attract representative with diverse background? Who really are these deputies, and how do they compare to what we might expect from a representative assembly?",

    "text": "3.1.1 The Numbers of Power\nThe snap elections of September 25, 2022 produced a clear result that Italy has not seen in a while: the Center-Right bloc won a comfortable majority, largely thanks to the rise of Fratelli d’Italia (FdI), which went from being a minor party to the largest one in Parliament in a short time.\nThis outcome was strenghtened by the “Rosatellum” electoral law: out of 400 seats, 148 deputies were elected via the uninominal colleges (First Past the Post method). The governing coalition, composed of Fratelli d’Italia, Lega and Forza Italia (FI), dominated this contest, sweeping 123 of the 148 single-member districts. These candidates were supported by the entire coalition, and are often grouped by their broader bloc, while the remaining were assigned via proportional plurinominal lists.\nBut does the electoral victory actually translate into control of the Chamber? The numbers suggest Yes.\n\n\nCode\ndf_deputati_final |&gt;\n  # 1. Count the number of deputies for each party\n  count(party_acronym, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  \n  # 2.

The country’s first female Prime Minister came from the Right, not the Left: Giorgia Meloni broke through a “Glass ceiling” for females in the political world that many progressive parties have tried for decades but didn’t succeed.\nIs this a true paradox? The data below provides a answer: No.\nWhile the Right produced the national figurehead, Left and Center-Left parties elect and maintain a significantly higher percentage of women. Meloni may be the most visible woman in Italian politics, but her own coalition is still predominantly male.\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

Some European parliaments have many former civil servants but Italy’s does not.\nThe data highlights a dominance of Lawyers and Professional Politicians, often categorized under “Other” since they lack an alternative career. Meanwhile, people who work in healthcare, education, or the private sector are underrepresented.\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

The country is like a mosaic of distinct socio-economic identities, and the voting data reflects this distinction.\nWhile Fratelli d’Italia (FdI) is a national “homogenizer”, other forces are deeply based in specific areas:\n\nThe North: This is the stronghold of Lega (born as a northern autonomist party) and SVP (representing linguistic minorities in South Tyrol).\nThe Center-North: The traditional “Red Belt” that represents the Democratic Party (PD).\nThe South: The Five Star Movement (M5S) dominates here, where people are often discontent because of the economical disadvantages of this region.\n\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

    "text": "3.2 The “Short Week” Reality\nThere is a popular joke in Rome: “Parliament opens on Tuesday and closes on Thursday.” The stereotype depicts deputies as commuters who arrive in the capital on Monday night and rush to the airports by Thursday afternoon.\nIs this just a myth? The data suggests no.\n\n3.2.1 The Weekly Rhythm\nThe analysis of voting timestamps confirms the “Short Week” is not a myth. The legislative machine runs at full speed only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Mondays and Fridays are phantom days, with low voting activity. The data validates the stereotype: for the average deputy, the parliamentary week effectively lasts 48 to 72 hours.\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

The Chamber shuts down for summer vacation and voting activity drops drastically. But the month before that, in July, there’s a noticeable spike as deputies rush to do as much as possible before the break. You see a similar pattern around Easter in April, with a smaller peak in March as work ramps up beforehand.\nAnother pattern is observed in December, which is intense in workload because of the annual Budget Law deadline.\nThe result is a legislature that operates in bursts: long stretches of low activity followed by frantic voting as a deadline or a holiday approaches.\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

    "text": "While this analysis provides a deep dive into the XIX Legislature, it is more of a structural overview. The current dataset allows us to measure volume and alignment, we can see the broad patterns, the shape of the coalitions, and how votes tend to cluster.\nBut to really understand the finer dynamics of the Italian parliament, we’d need to go deeper with the integration of more detailed and granular data.\nFuture directions to focus on are:\n\nInternal cohesion and defectors (Franchi Tiratori): political drama often happen within the same party. With access to individual roll-call votes (who voted for what), we could measure Party Discipline to identify which groups are most likely to internal conflicts and votes against their own coalition.\nParty switching(Cambio di Casacca): we assigned one party per deputy based on election results. We could track changes in the Deputies’ affiliation over time and reveal their political loyalty, and whether the old tradition of trasformismo (where politicians drift towards the one in power) still exists.\nConflict Analysis: applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the text of amendments and parliamentary debates would allow us to see which topics spark the most conflict.\nGovernment vs. Parliament Efficiency: how many bills proposed by MPs actually become law compared to those initiated by the Government? Analyzing the “failure rate” of private member bills versus government decrees would tell us a lot about the real balance of power.\n\nIn conclusion, while the numbers confirm the stability and discipline of the current majority Party, the true health of a democracy is measured not only by the efficiency of its voting machine, but also by the quality of its debate and the independence of its representatives. Expanding this dataset is the first step toward that deeper understanding.",

    "text": "2.4 Missing Data and NAs\nBecause our data comes from RDF triplets rather than a neat Excel spreadsheet, “missing values” here don’t just mean empty cells. They often represent missing links in the web of data or optional fields that were left blank.\n\nUndeclared Personal Information: the description field is supposed to be a catch-all for biographical info, like education and previous jobs. But since deputies aren’t forced to share this, many simply don’t.\nStructural NAs: we also found plenty of missing values in technical columns, but these are actually reflections of how the Parliament works. Some deputies get elected in single-member districts, where they run as part of a coalition rather than a single party: these deputies don’t have a direct parliamentary office (rif_ufficioParlamentare) link. Similalry the majority of the deputy is a standard member of the assembly and doesn’t hold a special leadership role (rif_incarico), like Committee President or Questore.\n\n\n\nCode\n# --- 1.
