    "text": "1 Introduction\nFor the international observer, Italian politics is often reduced to a caricature of instability: a revolving door of Prime Ministers, technocratic crisis managers, and executives that barely last longer than a football season. Since the birth of the Republic in 1946, Italy has seen nearly 70 different governments: an average of one every 13 months.\nFor us, as two Italians, this volatility is not just a statistic; it is the background noise of our civic lives. We are accustomed to a system designed to prevent authoritarianism but often accused of breeding paralysis. We know the rituals: the consultations at the Quirinale, the votes of confidence, and the constant reshuffling of alliances.\nHowever, the current XIX Legislature offers a rare opportunity for analysis. For the first time in years, the Chamber of Deputies is not held hostage by a fragile coalition, but is driven by a clear political majority. This shift changes the physics of the parliamentary hall. It moves the conversation from “will the government survive the night?” to “how is the legislative machine actually functioning?”\nBeneath the headlines and the talk-show rhetoric, the Parliament is a massive data generator. Every electronic vote, every committee attendance, and every legislative text leaves a digital footprint.\nIn this project, we move beyond the narrative of instability to look at the empirical reality. Using the Linked Open Data provided by the Camera dei Deputati, we perform a quantitative autopsy of the current term, organized into three distinct stories:\n\nThe Players (Who Represents Us?) Before analyzing their actions, we must understand their identity. Who sits in the 400 seats of the reduced Chamber? We explore the demographics, the “Meloni Paradox” regarding gender balance, and the sharp geographic divide that still splits the country between North and South.\nThe “Short Week” Reality There is a popular saying that deputies work only from Tuesday to Thursday. Is it a populist myth or a statistical fact? We analyze the timestamps of thousands of votes to reveal the true heartbeat of the Chamber, exposing the “school calendar” rhythm of legislative activity.\nThe Palace Games Beyond the shouting matches on TV, how does the voting machine actually work? We map the “Geometry of Consensus” to show that enemies often vote together on technicalities, expose the tactical use of Strategic Abstention, and analyze whether the solid majority truly holds when the final roll call is summoned.\n\nThis is not just a study of laws; it is a data-driven tour of the Italian Parliament, stripping away the noise to see how the Republic actually works.",

Unlike static archival datasets, this repository functions as a living digital archive of the Italian Republic, updated continuously to reflect parliamentary activity in real-time.\nThe analysis focuses specifically on the XIX Legislature, which commenced on October 13, 2022. This period represents a significant break in the recent history of Italian political instability, characterized by a clear electoral winner and a defined parliamentary majority.",

Following the constitutional referendum of 2020, the number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies has been drastically cut from 630 to 400.\nThis smaller, leaner assembly is no longer just a crowd; it is a selected cohort where every single vote carries more weight than ever before. But who are these 400 individuals chosen to represent a nation of 60 million? Are they the usual career politicians, or has the reduction of seats created a new breed of representative?\nBefore we analyze what they do, we must understand who they are.

It includes metadata on the subject of the vote (e.g., amendments, confidence votes) and the aggregate tallies (Present, Voting, Ayes, Nays, Abstentions).\nseduta-19.rdf (Sessions): The “calendar” of the Chamber. This dataset links every vote to a specific session date, providing the temporal backbone necessary to analyze the rhythm of legislative work (Story II).\ndeputato-19.rdf (Deputies): The demographic registry of the 400 elected officials. It contains personal attributes such as gender, age, profession, and education level, allowing for the sociological profiling of the ruling class (Story I).\nelezione-19.rdf (Elections): The geographic link.

    "text": "2.3 Data Quality and Limitations\nThe transition from Semantic Web standards (triplets) to tabular data presents specific challenges. A preliminary review confirms that while the numerical data (vote counts) is robust and complete, the categorical metadata requires significant harmonization.\nSpecifically, the “Missing Data Analysis” reveals a structural limitation regarding Parliamentary Groups (parties). In the raw RDF structure, party affiliation is often referenced via “Blank Nodes” or links to external datasets (organo.rdf) not included in this specific snapshot. Consequently, while we can track the behavior of individual deputies with high precision, mapping them to their specific political parties requires inferential matching or supplementary data collection.\nFurthermore, the dataset distinguishes between the theoretical composition of the Chamber and the active workforce. Resignations, substitutions (subentri), and deaths create a fluctuating number of active IDs, which must be normalized to avoid skewing attendance metrics.",

    "text": "3.1.1 The Numbers of Power\nThe snap elections of September 25, 2022, delivered a decisive verdict, ending a decade of hung parliaments. The vote handed a sweeping majority to the Center-Right coalition, driven by the unprecedented rise of Fratelli d’Italia (FdI), which established itself as the leading political force.\nThis outcome was amplified by the “Rosatellum” electoral law, a complex mixed system. Out of 400 seats, 147 deputies were elected in winner-takes-all uninominal colleges (single-member districts), where coalition unity is key, while the remaining were assigned via proportional plurinominal lists.\nDoes this translate into a solid command of the Chamber?

Unlike other European parliaments often populated by civil servants, the Italian Chamber reveals a different DNA.\nThe data highlights a prevalence of Lawyers and Professional Politicians, often categorized under “Other” as they lack a distinct alternative career. Meanwhile, key sectors of society—such as healthcare, education, and the private corporate sector—remain underrepresented, suggesting a disconnect between the legislative body and the everyday workforce.\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

The country is not a uniform block but a mosaic of distinct socio-economic identities, and the voting data confirms a historical fracture.\nWhile Fratelli d’Italia (FdI) acts as a national homogenizer, other forces are deeply rooted in specific territories:\n\nThe North: This is the stronghold of Lega (born as a northern autonomist party) and SVP (representing linguistic minorities in South Tyrol).\nThe Center-North: The traditional “Red Belt” remains the primary reservoir for the Democratic Party (PD).\nThe South: The Five Star Movement (M5S) dominates here, channeling the discontent of the economically disadvantaged regions.\n\nThe chart below sorts parties by their presence in the North (Blue), revealing a clear gradient from the Alps to the Islands.\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

    "text": "3.2 The “Short Week” Reality\nThere is a popular and often malicious saying in Rome: Parliament opens on Tuesday and closes on Thursday. The stereotype depicts deputies as commuters who arrive in the capital on Monday night and rush to the airports by Thursday afternoon.\nIs this just a populist myth? The data suggests otherwise.\n\n3.2.1 The Weekly Rhythm\nThe analysis of voting timestamps confirms the “Short Week” is not a myth; it is the operating system of the Chamber. The legislative machine runs at full speed only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Mondays and Fridays are phantom days, with almost zero voting activity. The data validates the stereotype: for the average deputy, the parliamentary week effectively lasts 48 to 72 hours.\n\n\nCode\n# 1. Data Preparation: Extracting Time Components\ndf_activity &lt;- df_votazioni |&gt;\n  # Convert the date string (YYYYMMDD) into a proper Date object\n  mutate(date = ymd(date)) |&gt;\n  # Remove rows with missing dates\n  filter(!is.na(date)) |&gt;\n  # Extract the Day of the Week (Mon, Tue, Wed...)\n  # label = TRUE returns text (e.g., \"Monday\") instead of numbers\n  mutate(weekday = wday(date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE, week_start = 1))\n\n# 2.

August is the month of the great exodus: the Chamber effectively shuts down for the summer break, dropping to near-zero activity.\nConversely, July witnesses a frantic spike in voting, a legislative sprint to clear the desk before the holidays begin. Coupled with the traditional December rush for the Budget Law, the data reveals a clear cyclic rhythm: the Parliament operates on a “school calendar,” with distinct terms and long vacations.\n\n\nCode\n# 1.
